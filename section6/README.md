### Intersection Types
allows us to combine other types

### Type Guards
allows us to check if a property or method exists before we try to use it

### Discriminated Unions
its a patter wich you can use when working with union types that makes implementing type guards easily

consists on adding a common property that helps discern between 2 different implementation of different interfaces

### Type Casting
Helps by telling typescript that some value is of a specific type where typescript is not able to identify it by itself

### Index Properties
a feature that allows us to create objects which are more flexible regarding the properties that can hold

### Function Overloads
a feature that allows us to define multiple functions signatures for the same function

### Optional Chaining
using ? you can check if the value is present, and if it is, access it

### Nullish Coalesing
you can check if a value is null (and null only, not falsy as eg: '', 0, undefined) by using the double ?? to specify that
